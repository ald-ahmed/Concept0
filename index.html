                            <p>Hi!</p>
                            <p>There's a problem with the way science functions today. Scientific literature is often so focused on it&rsquo;s inner-circle audience (researchers and other scientists), that it neglects the task of sharing and explaining the results to the more general population. This crucial task of communication is often left up to the media, which in attempting to gain the reader&rsquo;s attention will either sensationalize findings or risk not being read at all.</p>
                            <p>This hints at broader issue at hand, which is effective communication of findings. How do we begin to make science more understandable? Or perhaps politics? Or for that matter any other highly-specialized sector of life?</p>
                            <p>I&rsquo;m not completely sure how to solve this issue, but I do happen to be an undergraduate CS student who&rsquo;s interested in machine learning. I understand some but not all machine learning papers I read, and I find it discouraging to know that I will only begin to understand this topic in perhaps 4, 5, or 6 years from now.</p>
                            <p>With the aim to provide some insight into this issue, and through the spirit of scientific research and open source work, I present Concept 0.</p>
                            <p>This is a project that explores natural language processing - but with a twist.</p>
                              <blockquote>The mission is simple: attempt to create a natural language processing AI, and in doing so, outline, explore, and present the results from the perspective of a student.</blockquote>
                            <p>This means less usage of highly scientific&nbsp;terminology and more of simple, easy to understand research results for anyone to examine and learn from. More specifically, this is a project that aims to explore what occurs when we attempt to model computer algorithms using what we know about psychology and neuroscience.</p>
